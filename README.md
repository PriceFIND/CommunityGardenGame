# CommunityGardenGame
Game to promote Price City Community Garden
Okay the goal is to make a simple community gardening sim game.
so we want to use some html and JavaScript for the game
and use some of the database stuff we learned to track the emails and high scores
it might take a few different pages, or documents and we will be using the new Atom IDE because it does cool stuff and it's time to level up our awesome sauce :)
